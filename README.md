# Encyclopedia of monsters

I'm very happy to present my first essential project in django.

My website is an encyclopedia of endemic creatures from my imagination.

The story behind this work is very simple : An Irish fisherman crew after a storm discovered a new island in the north of Atlantic ocean. When they came back to their homeland, they narrated their discovery but no one believed them. However a group of international scientific organized an expedition to prove the fishermens words. 

After passed during several month in this island, where they took notes about the wildlife, they return to their laboratory and create an encyclopedia of monsters.

This site index the endemic animals of the nameless island.
